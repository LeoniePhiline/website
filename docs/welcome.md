# Welcome to Ntex

Ntex lets you quickly and confidently develop web services in Rust and this guide will get you going in no time.

The documentation on this website focusses primarily on the Ntex Web framework.<br />

If you already know your way around and you need specific information you might want to read the [ntex API docs][ntex-docs].
